# Welcome to the CoCoTools project

We have designed CoCoTools as a software library to allow users of
various interests and technical proficiencies to mine the CoCoMac database in
its current form.

Installation instructions:

Installation of CoCoTools is not required to access the package.
However, if you do not install it, you can only access CoCoTools' modules
while your Python session is inside the cocotools directory,
or you add cocotools to your PATH. We highly recommend you install cocotools,
which makes the package available from any directory.

On a non-Windows system:

1) Open a terminal and cd to the cocotools directory with the setup.py in it.
   It is also where this README is.
   
2) From the terminal, type: python setup.py install
